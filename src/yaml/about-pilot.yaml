  # About the Pilot

  Our month long pilot program sought to investigate three questions. Firstly, how we can empower humanities students to develop digital tools to do humanitiesâ€™ research. Secondly, how collaborations with private parties can enrich educational experiences and thirdly, how an alternative classroom setting could stimulate new types of learning. Through this intensive collaboratively-oriented educational course, inspiration, input and reflection from private parties and the enthusiastic efforts of the involved students in the co-workspace that was set up, Coding the Humanities succeeded in answering these questions and reaching its goals. 

  The latter can be summarized as follows: The course helps students and researchers understand the various technologically mediated objects that they are studying.

  It facilitates the development of custom tools, rather than using ready-made ones, which improves the actual practice of humanities research as well as (the quantity and quality) of its output. This is especially relevant, keeping in mind the ever-growing demand in the public and private sector for academics who can read and write code.
