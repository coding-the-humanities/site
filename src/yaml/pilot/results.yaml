  # Introduction 

  > “The whole experience has been a blast! From programming to the collaborative progress. Even the great amount of information in a short time really worked for me. I think this style of education just really fits me.”

  Our month long pilot program sought to investigate three questions:  

  1. How can we empower humanities students to develop digital tools to do humanities’ research. 
  
  2. How can collaborations with private parties can enrich educational experiences 
  
  3. How can an alternative classroom setting stimulate new types of learning. 
  
  Through this intensive collaboratively-oriented educational course, inspiration, input and reflection from private parties and the enthusiastic efforts of the involved students in the co-workspace that was set up, Coding the Humanities succeeded in answering these questions and reaching its goals. 

  The latter can be summarized as follows: The course helps students and researchers understand the various technologically mediated objects that they are studying.

  It facilitates the development of custom tools, rather than using ready-made ones, which improves the actual practice of humanities research as well as (the quantity and quality) of its output. This is especially relevant, keeping in mind the ever-growing demand in the public and private sector for academics who can read and write code.



  ## From student to researcher

  > “I learned that I really like the humanities”

  One of the goals of the pilot was the empowerment of the humanities students to become confident researchers who can build their own digital tools. Building their own tools allowed students to investigate and question the content and boundaries of data sets, and learn about the language of programming through actual programming: about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Polymer, how to create webcomponents and how to share their work using GIT. This sharing of code was essential to creating their eventual “Coding the Humanities: Housemouse” project. In the set up of the pilot, the students were treated as team members – who worked in small groups on their part of the project, aided by the instructors who for example engaged the group in pair programming sessions and set weekly deadlines to complete parts of the project or present the research-in-the-making to visitors and experts during weekly evening events.

  The students were decidedly positive in their assessment of their Coding the Humanities experience.


  > “It makes me feel like I can actually do useful stuff”
  > “When Jan Hein en Marijn did a pair programming session. They live coded a little project as an example. It was great to see how fast they were able to make something work on the screen. It was great fun and I learned a lot from it.”

  ## The alternative classroom: the co-working space

  > “[…] I found the collaborative working aspect so enjoyable. I enjoy working together as in discussing our work, but I usually work alone when I have to make something on the computer. I really didn't like it when people stare at my screen when I work. Yet that has completely changed because of the pair programming. I now value it and no longer feel afraid to make mistakes.”

  Part of the empowerment of students, was the result of the context that was created to situate their learning experiences. The Coding the Humanities pilot was set up in a co-working space in the PCHoofthuis, one of the University of Amsterdam’s building in the city center. Prior to the pilot, the team transformed one larger space and the connected adjacent rooms into a co-working space with desks, chairs, plants, tetris-shaped carpet, pillows and couches. Here, the students, teachers, experts and visitors could not only sit down to work on their computers, or attend presentations, but the space could also be used to relax, to drink coffee or tea and eat together. One of the first assignments for the students was to decorate the space even more, using their own posters and objects. The space was, for one month, their work area – which also meant that they tidied it up and made sure that it stayed neat and presentable, yet also an environment to experiment and work together.

  Students reported after the pilot that because of the “look and feel”, the idea of partial “ownership” and due to the fact that they were effectively in the space every day (sometimes even after 17:30), the space worked particularly enhance the feeling of working together as a team. The space was noted as essential to the collaborative atmosphere in the group; group exercises – such as stand up’s in the morning, brainstorm and other more creative exercises. The only thing that was missing when the days were particularly hot, was a fan.

  > “Working this intensively in groups showed me how I would behave in a much more 'realistic' situation. I think I learned a lot from that.”

  > “Getting to know new people who are (more or less) interested in the same thing as I am, and participating with them in this interest.”


  ## Enriching public-private collaborations

  From its inception, the pilot was geared at involving public and private partners to promote the sharing and circulation of both hands-on practices and theoretical knowledge. Throughout the pilot, experts visited

  Changed perspectives

  Expectations (aanmeldingen) en evaluatie

  Students wanted to join because:

  > “For a new media professional, the mastering of some programming languages is something that cannot be lacking. Apart from career perspectives, the coding of Humanities has a tremendous value for our academic field. Some of the most influential researchers in New Media - for example Lev Manovich or Friedrich Kittler - have experience in programming. This experience make their claims about New Media a lot stronger.” Charlie

  > “As a designer I never really have to code anything. I just provide the pretty pictures, but what i really want is the ability to combine data, interactivity and design. I love the idea of being able to actually create a tool that is useful.” (…). “I love the fact that this is a crash course and that it is an intensive hands on experience.  It is a great opportunity for me because it is exactly what i want to learn.” Taeke

  > “I really like programming and I am very interested to see how it can be applied to the humanities.” Roel

  > “The course ""coding the humanities"" is exactly what I'm looking for because it does involve data and technology but is likewise consciousness of the necessity of theory and concepts before using data and technology for discovering structures and answering (big) questions for the humanities.”Reinier
