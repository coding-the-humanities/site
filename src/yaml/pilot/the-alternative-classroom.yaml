  One of our goals was to use context as a way to empower the students. We asked the question "How can an alternative classroom setting stimulate new types of learning?" Together we created a space where students, teachers, experts, and visitors could work and relax together.

  One of the first assignments for the students was to decorate the pilot space, which was situated in one of the University of Amsterdam's buildings in the city center. Prior to the pilot, the Coding the Humanities team had transformed a large space and a few adjacent rooms into a co-working space with desks, chairs, plans, pillows, couches and a tetris-shaped carpet. The students used posters and private objects to make the space their own. 

  > “I found the collaborative working aspect so enjoyable. I enjoy working together as in discussing our work, but I usually work alone when I have to make something on the computer. I really didn't like it when people stare at my screen when I work. Yet that has completely changed because of the pair programming. I now value it and no longer feel afraid to make mistakes.”

  Whereas usually humanities students spend around 10-14 hours in a classroom per week, during the pilot the students were in the co-working space every day from early in the morning until sometimes even after 5:30PM. Being together this intensively was essential for the collaborative atmosphere of the group. After the pilot, students reported after the pilot that the “look and feel”, and the idea of partial “ownership” of the area that the space worked particularly to enhance the feeling of working together as a team. 

  > “Working this intensively in groups showed me how I would behave in a much more 'realistic' situation. I think I learned a lot from that.”

  The only thing that was missing when the days were particularly hot was a fan. And a TV to watch the World Cup.
