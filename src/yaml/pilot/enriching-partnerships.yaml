  From its inception, the pilot was geared at involving public and private partners to learn how collaborations with private parties can enrich educational experiences. It was amazing to learn that the learning experience was two-fold. Students learned about many possible perspectives and applications of coding and especially enjoyed to learn that many of the concepts programmers work with are similar to the concepts they work with as humanities students. The experts who visisted enjoyed the humanities perspective the students brought to their programming and the questions they asked. Many of the experts who visisted have expressed the wish to stay connected to Coding the Humanities in the future. Here's an overview:

  Jan Willem Tulp from [Tulp Interactive](http://tulpinteractive.com/about/) lectured and assisted the students over several days during the pilot. 

  Alexandro Mancusi from [Weyeser](http://weyeser.com) provided the students access to the open data set they used in their project and gave a seminar on the use of GoogleRefine to get the students going with their data explorations.

  Federico Bonelli from [Trasformatorio](http://www.trasformatorio.net/?page_id=15) discussed the idea of thinking about concepts such as "truth" and "reality" from a different perspective and to open up ideas about data and the "nature of knowledge". He also gave a workshop about how you can communicate your identity in a tactile way as opposed to verbalizing ideas about yourself.

  Ashley Williams from [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com/) (Bocoup) came over for three days all the way from Boston. She lectured about her experiences with teaching programming to humanities researchers and how coding and the humanities enrich each other.

  > “I learned a lot from Ashley Williams when she came over from Boston to teach. (…) Ashley brought many of the scattered coding skills I had together in very simple exercises which gave me important insights in my actual progress and possible further development.”

  Strategic innovator Nigel Hamlin introduced and advised on project management and control, but also acted as a general mentor to the students, advising on the issues that can and do arise in a software development environment. He came by for one day and ended up staying for two weeks. 

  Lex Slaghuis and Arjan el Fassed from the [Open State Foundation](http://openstate.eu/) gave a presentation about open data and the use and sharing of information and data.

  Wolfgang Haas and Wolfgang Scheikl from [CastYourArt](http://castyourart.com) gave a presentation about their company and provided extensive feedback to the final student project and the group dynamic that was so important to the course as a whole.
