 The Coding the Humanities pilot introduced students from the humanities faculty of the University of Amsterdam to the world of programming. The experiences offered by the pilot and the final Project House Mouse are the stepping stone for future Coding the Humanities endeavors.

  Currently, the team is working to establish more opportunities for students and researchers to engage in public-private-civic projects. The angle of “research through coding” offered by the Coding the Humanities team, offers companies and institutes the opportunity to articulate and solve problems, empower people through learning and teaching one another, with a specific focus on developing digital tools together. 

  Collaboration between different parties not only enriches research processes, it also proves to lead to more lasting partnerships. So far, we have placed one of our teaching assistants as product developer at the university, hired one of our students as our external relations manager and junior developer, and selected three interns to work on the development of the new Coding the Humanities platform. Also, we are working to facilitate two expernal PhDs.  

  Key themes for future projects are empowerment through collaborative learning, the circulation of (tacit) knowledge to develop innovative ideas and the immediate practical application of insights through building together.
