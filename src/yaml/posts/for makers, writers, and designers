  In 2015 we organise a conference and a festival that connects innovative thinkers worldwide and will offer the ultimate annual platform for inspiration and collaboration. 

  The conference consists of three tracks: for makers, writers, and designers. The tracks consist of workshops and lectures by prominent speakers, and sessions dedicated to brainstorming and creating the final piece. Participants take part in one of these tracks, where they will engage deeply with each other and their own discipline. Also, they will choose one of the two other tracks to broaden their knowledge and facilitate collaboration between disciplines. During these two days, the participants create a series of pieces that are based on the interfaces of existing artworks.  

  The conference results into an exhibition that is open to a wide audience of researchers, press, and people from the art and tech scene. During a one-day festival the collaborative pieces that were created during the conference are on display, and present the results of two days of collaborative thinking, learning and building. 

  Both the conference and the festival will be documented by CastYourArt and made into a short film. The other partners that make possible the conference and festival are Lifely, University of Amsterdam, and the cities of Amsterdam and Vienna.
