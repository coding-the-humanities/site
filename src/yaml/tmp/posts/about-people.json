  "content": "Jan Hein Hoogstad is assistant professor and self taught programmer. He convinces students that they're already teachers, strives to redefine the academic publication system, and works on the development of educational platforms that encourage collaboration, iteration, and research. Besides teaching in the Coding the Humanities pilot, Jan Hein is lead developer of the new Coding the Humanities platform. \n\nMarijn Koolen teaches humanities scholars at the University of Amsterdam and Coding the Humanities to embrace tool building as a useful academic activity. His spends most of his time trying to combine his interests for coding and books and likes to build all kinds of tools for close-reading, distant-reading and not reading. He occasionally does the reading himself. \n\nSabrina Sauer is assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam. With a background in acting and a PhD on living labs, she viewed the students in the Coding the Humanities pilot as her lab rats. She refrained from performing crude experiments on them, and facilitated and guarded the collaborative space created in this alternative and intensive classroom setting. \n\nReika Egawa-Chavers is project manager, junior developer and Coding the Humanities's cheerful external relations manager. She was part of the Coding the Humanities pilot course and pursues a degree in New Media at the University of Amsterdam. She also organises the Coding the Humanities conference and festival in 2015 and contributes her coding skills to the development of the new Coding the Humanities platform. \n\nRobin Boast is the Professor of Cultural Information Science and heads the Media and Information section of Media Studies. He embedded Coding the Humanities in a new minor on Digital Media. His work focuses on how diverse knowledges are enabled, empowered and gain expression in digital media, and on the continuing colonial and enlightenment impediments that continue to constrain open access.\n"
