  "content": "Our first research question was: \"How can we empower humanities students to develop digital tools to do humanities research?\" Building your own tools allows students to investigate and question the content and boundaries of data sets, the possibilities and restrictions of different markup and programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Polymer, build and understand webcomponents, and how to share their work using git. \n\nBy sharing their work on git, the students were stimulated from the very beginning to share and collaborate. The sharing of code on git was essential to create their [Project House Mouse](http://housemouse.codingthehumanities.com), which is a co-creation of all the students in the group. Following the set-up of the pilot, the students worked in small teams. Each team focused on their part of the project, aided by the instructors who engaged the group in pair programming sessions, and set weekly deadlines to complete parts of the project or present the research-in-the-making to visitors and experts during weekly evening events.\n\n > “[...] Jan Hein en Marijn did a pair programming session. They live coded a little project as an example. It was great to see how fast they were able to make something work on the screen. It was great fun and I learned a lot from it.”\n\nAfter seeing a pair programming session in action, students were stimulated to work together behind their computers too. Even though their programming knowledge was still very limited they learned that they did know how to ask the right questions, which is a skill that they learned as humanities students. \n\n> “I learned that I really like the humanities.”\n\nBy asking these questions to each other, the instructors, guests, and Google, the students learned to think like programmers.    \n\n \n"
