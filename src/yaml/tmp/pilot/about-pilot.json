  "content": "The Coding the Humanities pilot introduced students from the humanities faculty of the University of Amsterdam to the world of programming. During one month, every working day, students follow an intensive course on HTML, CSS and Javascript. Experts from the industry give lectures and workshops on the basics of web development, programming, project management, and databases. The students work in groups and on collaborative projects.\n\n> “The whole experience has been a blast! From programming to the collaborative progress. Even the great amount of information in a short time really worked for me. I think this style of education just really fits me.”\n\nThe group of students comes from a variety of disciplines within the Humanities, such as Media Studies, European Studies, Philosophy and Musicology. The goal of the project is to learn how to program in order to have more control over one's own research. Everybody starts out on different levels of coding skills, but through collaboration and pair programming, all students manage to enhance their knowledge. This project is not just educational. It's also a lot of fun (and frustrating, but that's part of writing code).\n\nIn our month long pilot program, we investigated three questions:  \n\n1. How can we empower humanities students to develop digital tools to do humanities’ research. \n\n2. How can collaborations with private parties can enrich educational experiences \n\n3. How can an alternative classroom setting stimulate new types of learning. \n\nThrough this intensive collaboratively-oriented educational course, inspiration, input and reflection from private parties and the enthusiastic efforts of the involved students in the co-workspace that was set up, Coding the Humanities succeeded in answering these questions and reaching its goals. \n\n\nThe latter can be summarized as follows: The course helps students and researchers understand the various technologically mediated objects that they are studying.\n"
