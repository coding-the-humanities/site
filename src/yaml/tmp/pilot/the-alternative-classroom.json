  "content": "> “[…] I found the collaborative working aspect so enjoyable. I enjoy working together as in discussing our work, but I usually work alone when I have to make something on the computer. I really didn't like it when people stare at my screen when I work. Yet that has completely changed because of the pair programming. I now value it and no longer feel afraid to make mistakes.”\n\nPart of the empowerment of students, was the result of the context that was created to situate their learning experiences. The Coding the Humanities pilot was set up in a co-working space in the PCHoofthuis, one of the University of Amsterdam’s building in the city center. Prior to the pilot, the team transformed one larger space and the connected adjacent rooms into a co-working space with desks, chairs, plants, tetris-shaped carpet, pillows and couches. Here, the students, teachers, experts and visitors could not only sit down to work on their computers, or attend presentations, but the space could also be used to relax, to drink coffee or tea and eat together. One of the first assignments for the students was to decorate the space even more, using their own posters and objects. The space was, for one month, their work area – which also meant that they tidied it up and made sure that it stayed neat and presentable, yet also an environment to experiment and work together.\n\nStudents reported after the pilot that because of the “look and feel”, the idea of partial “ownership” and due to the fact that they were effectively in the space every day (sometimes even after 17:30), the space worked particularly enhance the feeling of working together as a team. The space was noted as essential to the collaborative atmosphere in the group; group exercises – such as stand up’s in the morning, brainstorm and other more creative exercises. The only thing that was missing when the days were particularly hot, was a fan.\n\n> “Working this intensively in groups showed me how I would behave in a much more 'realistic' situation. I think I learned a lot from that.”\n\n> “Getting to know new people who are (more or less) interested in the same thing as I am, and participating with them in this interest.”\n"
