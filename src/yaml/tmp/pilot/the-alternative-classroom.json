  "content": "Part of the pilot was to use the context as a way to empower students. Together we created a space where students, teachers, experts, and visitors could work and relax together.\n\nOne of the first assigments for the students was to decorate the pilot space, which was situated in one of the University of Amsterdam's buildings in the city center. Prior to the pilot, the Coding the Humanities team had transformed a large space and a few adjacent rooms into a co-working space with desks, chairs, plans, pillows, couches and a tetris-shaped. The students used posters and private objects to make the space their own. \n\n> “I found the collaborative working aspect so enjoyable. I enjoy working together as in discussing our work, but I usually work alone when I have to make something on the computer. I really didn't like it when people stare at my screen when I work. Yet that has completely changed because of the pair programming. I now value it and no longer feel afraid to make mistakes.”\n\nAfter the pilot, students reported after the pilot that the “look and feel”, and the idea of partial “ownership” of the area that the space worked particularly to enhance the feeling of working together as a team. Also the fact that the students were in that space every day (sometimes even until after 5.30PM), was essential for the collaboratative atmosphere in the group.  \n\n> “Working this intensively in groups showed me how I would behave in a much more 'realistic' situation. I think I learned a lot from that.”\n\nThe only thing that was missing when the days were particularly hot was a fan.\n"
